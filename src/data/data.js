    whatText: "It is an agile project management framework. Imagine Scrum like breaking work into small steps that you do as a team, trying new things as you go and getting feedback to get better. It's about working together to deliver value bit by bit. Scrum gives you a bit of a roadmap to follow, but you can customize it to fit what works best for you.",
    whyText: "Scrum draws its name from the Rugby formation, in which players huddle together in a 'scrum,' aiming to move the ball forward. Translating this concept to a development team, Scrum unites the team with the common objective of progressing the product.",
    historyText: "Scrum is a framework defined in 1995 by the creators Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber. If you need to understand how Scrum works, but don't want to read the founder's well written and comprehensive Scrum Guide, you are in the right place! A Scrum team, consisting of a Product Owner, a Scrum Master, and Developers, is formed with specific accountabilities within the framework of Scrum methodology. Simply put;",
    dynamicsText: "In Scrum, a Scrum Master creates a supportive atmosphere where:",
    bulletOne: "The Product Owner organizes tasks for a complex issue in a Product Backlog.",
    bulletTwo: "The Scrum Team tackles chosen tasks to create valuable progress during a Sprint.",
    bulletThree: "The Scrum Team and stakeholders review the outcomes and adapt for the next Sprint",
    bulletFour: "This cycle repeats.",
    theoryText: "Since we know that scrum is a practical agile framework, why should we care about the theory? The answer is simple, scrum is like a guidebook. It shows us what’s important, sets rules and tells us how to apply them to reach our goals and achieve the things we value. Understanding its philosophy and principles is essential to follow its guidance.",
    secondTheoryText: "Scrum is founded on empiricism, which means that knowledge comes from experience and decisions are made from what is observed and from experimentation. It is also founded on Lean thinking to reduce waste and focuses on the essentials.",
    empiricismText: "Framework of development needs pillars to be supported  in the concept of working iteratively and to make it resistant to adverse effects. For Scrum these pillars are:",
    inspectionText: "To review the progress and variances, the team should frequently inspect Scrum artifacts, such as the product and sprint backlog.",
    inspectionPS: "We keep checking what we’ve done.",
    adaptionText:"If there are variations from the inspection that must be changed the team should be able to learn from this and make adjustments to improve it.",
    adaptionPS: "If something we’re doing doesn’t work well, we change it.",
    transparencyText: "To expose to the team our way of working, the way we think and make it visible for everyone who is involved to reduce risks and decisions that can lead to diminish values.",
    transparencyPS: "Everyone knows what we’re doing.",
    fiveValuesText: "To make the best and successful use of Scrum there are five values that also need to be met by everyone in the Team. The values help the team understand how to apply the Scrum rules and ceremonies in a good way and think of them as communication opportunities and improvement through making progress. The five values are:",
    commitmentCircleText:"The team should commit themselves and the goal. To help each other achieve the goal and finish tasks.",
    courageCircleText: "To be willing to accept when they are wrong, do the right things and work through difficult conversations and problems. To admit their mistakes.",
    focusCirleText:"Finish what they started and focus on accomplishing the goal and deliver the product.",
    openessCircleText:"To be honest and open to the team and its shareholders in what they do and deal with any challenges when performing that work.",
    respectCircleText:"Treat each other with respect and respect each other's backgrounds, experiences of work and abilities.",
    houseOfScrumTextOne: "Think of Scrum like a house. The foundation of this house is empiricism, and the pillars holding it up are Adaptation, Inspection, and Transparency. The walls are built with bricks representing the Scrum values. This analogy helps us understand how Scrum works.",
    houseOfScrumTextTwo:"Just like a house, if you remove the foundation, the house falls. If the pillars break, the roof caves in. If the walls get damaged, the house is exposed to weather. This metaphor shows how crucial it is to have a solid structure in Scrum, with all its parts working together.",

Their primary responsibility is to curate and prioritize the product backlog, ensuring that the team focuses on delivering the most valuable items first. The Product Owner works closely with the team to refine requirements and validate completed work.",
    scrumMasterText: "Serves as a guiding force for the team, ensuring adherence to Scrum principles and practices. Acting as a servant-leader, they facilitate the Scrum process, remove obstacles hindering progress, and coach the team in self-organization and cross-functionality. Additionally, the Scrum Master fosters a culture of continuous improvement by helping team members understand and embrace Scrum principles and practices.",
    developmentTeamText:"Consists of skilled professionals tasked with delivering potentially shippable product increments at the end of each Sprint. Composed of cross-functional members, the team autonomously organizes and executes their work. They collaborate closely with the Product Owner to comprehend requirements and ensure the delivery of valuable solutions to the customer.",

    bulletTwo: "Daily Scrum",
    bulletThree:"Sprint Review",
    bulletFour: "Sprint Retrospective",
    sprintPlanningText: "Sprint Planning kicks off each Sprint by helping the team decide what tasks they'll tackle and how they'll tackle them. It's like mapping out a route before a journey. During this event, both the Product Owner and Development Team work together to choose tasks from the Product Backlog that contribute to the Sprint Goal. Together, they craft a plan on how to accomplish these tasks, setting the team up for a successful Sprint.",
    dailyScrumText: "Daily Scrum is like a quick team huddle that happens every day. It's a short meeting where the Development Team comes together to sync up on their progress. They discuss what they worked on yesterday, what they plan to do today, and if there are any obstacles in their way. This daily check-in ensures everyone is on the same page and moving forward towards the Sprint Goal.",
    sprintReviewText:"Sprint Review is like a team showcase at the end of each Sprint. It's where the Development Team presents their completed work to the stakeholders, such as clients or managers. During this event, the team shares what they've accomplished and gathers feedback. This feedback helps ensure that the product increment meets the needs of the stakeholders and guides future development efforts.",
    retrospectiveText:"Sprint Retrospective is like a team's after-game analysis. After each Sprint, the team gathers to reflect on how they worked together. They talk about what went well and what could be improved for the next Sprint. This meeting helps the team learn from their experiences and become even better at working together over time.",
    eventConclusionText: "These Sprint Events are like the playbook for the Scrum team. They give the team a rhythm and routine to follow, making sure everyone knows what to do and when. By sticking to these events, the team can deliver small, valuable pieces of work step by step. It's all about staying organized, talking openly, and getting better together, just like a sports team strategizing during a game and cheering for each other's achievements.",

    bulletThree: "The Increment adheres to the Definition of Done.",
    whatTextThree: "These commitments are in place to uphold empiricism and the Scrum values for both the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.",
    productBacklogText: "The Product Backlog is like a to-do list for the work to be done, and it’s managed by the Scrum Team. They prioritize tasks, making sure they're clear and ready to be worked on during a Sprint. These tasks are often described as 'user stories', which help the team understand what needs to be done from the user's perspective. The tasks become clear and actionable through the process of refining them, adding details like descriptions, acceptance criteria and priority. The Product Goal, which is the commitment for the Product Backlog, is a target for where the product should be heading, and the tasks in the backlog help achieve that goal.",
    sprintBacklogText:"The Sprint Backlog is a detailed game plan for the Sprint, a period of time within which an estimated number of tasks (tickets/user stories) should be completed. The tasks of each Sprint are selected from the Product Backlog and serves as a reference point for progress evaluation during the Daily Scrum. Developers create this plan and it's continuously updated as they work to help them stay on track. The Sprint Goal keeps everyone focused on the main objective, allowing flexibility in how it's achieved.",
    incrementText: "The Increment marks a significant step toward reaching the Product Goal. It represents the total user stories/tickets completed during a Sprint, such as new features, improvements, or any changes made. Each Increment builds upon previous work and is thoroughly tested to ensure it works well and adds value. Multiple Increments can be completed within a Sprint, helping the team learn and improve continuously.",
    DODText: "The Definition of Done plays a crucial role in maintaining transparency and quality within the Increment. It must be followed by all team members. It sets clear criteria for what constitutes completed work, ensuring a shared understanding among the team. If a Product Backlog item fails to meet these criteria, it cannot be released or showcased at the Sprint Review at the end of a Sprint. Instead, it's returned to the Product Backlog for further refinement and potential inclusion in future Sprints.",
    sprintReviewText: "At the Sprint Review, the Increment is demonstrated and evaluated against the Sprint Goal, providing stakeholders with visibility into the progress made and gathering feedback for further refinement. This collaborative process ensures alignment with customer needs and enables iterative improvement of the product.",
    importanceOfArtifactsText: "The state of the three artifacts determine the future trajectory of the work as decisions are made based on them. It is important that all the work is conducted in a transparent way, meaning that every member of the team has access to the latest updates and information regarding the product backlog, Sprint backlog, and increment. Transparency ensures that everyone is on the same page, allowing for better collaboration, decision-making, and alignment with project goals. Without transparency, misunderstandings and miscommunications can arise, leading to delays, rework, and ultimately, a compromised product or project outcome.",
